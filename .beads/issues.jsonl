Inspired by the Coz paper's evaluation:\n- Memcached (9% improvement from contention fix)\n- SQLite (25% improvement from indirect call optimization)\n- PARSEC benchmarks (up to 68% from barrier optimization)\n\nEach example should:\n1. Have a discoverable performance problem\n2. Show measurable impact via causal profiling\n3. Demonstrate a fix with measured improvement\n4. Work with statistical validation (multiple runs)","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"brian@troutwine.us","created_at":"2026-01-12T22:10:19.390054612-08:00","created_by":"Brian L.
